# "ALI" ESP touch 2.8 inch made easy

_aka the cheap yellow TFT board or similar (e.g. a***xpress.com/item/1005006102451859.html)_

**Note: board was purchased in 2024**

I tried (as I always do)

https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI

which came out to be _somehow_ successful, but encountered the "**I will only fill 80% of your screen issue**"

Ok, switched to

https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX

which finally did the job

**Thx to the projects mentioned above.**
